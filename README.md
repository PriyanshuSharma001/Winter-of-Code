# Winter-of-Code
## Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## ML Bootcamp
The objective of this project is to learn the basics of Machine Learning (ML) and Creating ML Libraries from scratch in python.

The project consists of the following algorithms
### 1. Linear and Polynomial Regression
This is a supervised machine learning algorithm used when output is a continuous function of input features. When given a training set (input as well as expected output), it will try to understand the dependence of output on each input variable, generate a hypothesis and will identify a generalised trend that best suits the given data as well as helps to predict output of new input datasets.

### 2. Logistic Regression
This is a supervised machine learning algorithm used when the output is from some discrete values for any value of input features. When given a training set, it will try to learn different input objects are being classified into different classes bases on their features and it will generate a hypothesis or boundary between different classes that will help to classify new inputs.

### 3. K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
This is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies objects into different classes based on K closest neighbouring objects whose classes are already known.

### 4. K-Means Clustering
This is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that categories unlabelled data into K different groups.

### 5. Neural Networks 
This is a supervised machine learning algorithm that try to replicate how neurons in brain works. It works on a given training set and try to recognise patterns and trends and learn from them and optimize itself to interpret the data accurately.
